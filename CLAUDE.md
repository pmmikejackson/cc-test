# Claude Code Instructions

This file contains instructions and context for Claude Code to help with development tasks.

## Project Overview

**30-Day Python Learning Project**: Building an expense tracker app while learning Python from scratch.

**Savings Goal**: Increase savings from $35,000 to $40,000 ($5,000 target)

**Learning Approach**: Daily 25-60 minute sessions, each day builds on the previous day's work.

## Project Structure

```

├── LEARNING_PLAN.md     # Detailed 30-day curriculum
├── CLAUDE.md            # This file - session tracking and context
├── README.md            # Project overview
└── [app files will be added daily]
```

## Development Commands

*Will be updated as the project progresses*
- Python: `python3 app.py` (or similar)
- Later: Flask dev server, database commands, etc.

## Progress Tracking

**External Tracking:**
- Google Sheets: Daily progress checkboxes and notes
- GitHub: Code commits and version history

**Session Status Format:**
Update this section at the end of each coding session:

### Current Status (Day 0 - Setup Complete)
- **Completed**: Project setup, learning plan created, GitHub repo initialized
- **Next up**: Day 1 - Python setup, variables, first expense calculation
- **Issues/questions**: None
- **Files created**: LEARNING_PLAN.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md

## Code Conventions

*Will be established as we learn Python best practices*
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guide
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages

## Important Context for Claude

**Learning Level**: Complete Python beginner
**Focus**: Practical application while learning fundamentals  
**Git Learning**: Also learning git workflows alongside Python
**Real Goal**: The $40k savings target is real and should be integrated into app features
**Daily Habit**: Each session should end with a git commit and updated status in this file

## Troubleshooting Notes

*Add common issues and solutions as they arise*

## Ideas for Future Features

*Track ideas that come up during development*
